ChatGPT
Developer(s)	OpenAI
Initial release	November 30, 2022; 2 months ago
Type	Chatbot
License	Proprietary

ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer)[1] is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and is fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning)[2] with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. Its uneven factual accuracy was identified as a significant drawback.[3] Following the release of ChatGPT, OpenAI was valued at US$29 billion.[4]

Training
ChatGPT was fine-tuned on top of GPT-3.5 using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning.[5] Both approaches used human trainers to improve the model's performance. In the case of supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in which the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement step, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation. These rankings were used to create 'reward models' that the model was further fine-tuned on using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[6][7] Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms present a cost-effective benefit to trust region policy optimization algorithms; they negate many of the computationally expensive operations with faster performance.[8][9] The models were trained in collaboration with Microsoft on their Azure supercomputing infrastructure.

In addition, OpenAI continues to gather data from ChatGPT users that could be used to further train and fine-tune ChatGPT. Users are allowed to upvote or downvote the responses they receive from ChatGPT; upon upvoting or downvoting, they can also fill out a text field with additional feedback.[10][11]

Features and limitations

Conversation with ChatGPT about whether Jimmy Wales was involved in the Tiananmen Square protests, December 30, 2022
Although the core function of a chatbot is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. For example, it can write and debug computer programs,[12] to compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; to answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker);[13] to write poetry and song lyrics;[14] to emulate a Linux system; to simulate an entire chat room; to play games like tic-tac-toe; and to simulate an ATM.[15] ChatGPT's training data includes man pages and information about Internet phenomena and programming languages, such as bulletin board systems and the Python programming language.[15]

In comparison to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful responses.[16] In one example, whereas InstructGPT accepts the premise of the prompt "Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015" as being truthful, ChatGPT acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015, using information about the voyages of Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern world – including modern perceptions of Columbus' actions.[6]

Unlike most chatbots, ChatGPT remembers previous prompts given to it in the same conversation; journalists have suggested that this will allow ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist.[1] To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced from ChatGPT, queries are filtered through OpenAI's company-wide moderation API,[17][18] and potentially racist or sexist prompts are dismissed.[6][1]

ChatGPT suffers from multiple limitations. OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT "sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers".[6] This behavior is common to large language models and is called artificial intelligence hallucination.[19] The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, otherwise known as Goodhart's law.[20] ChatGPT has limited knowledge of events that occurred after 2021. According to the BBC, as of December 2022, ChatGPT is not allowed to "express political opinions or engage in political activism".[21] Yet, research suggests that ChatGPT exhibits a pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation when prompted to take a stance on political statements from two established voting advice applications.[22] In training ChatGPT, human reviewers preferred longer answers, irrespective of actual comprehension or factual content.[6] Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias, which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people. In one instance, ChatGPT generated a rap indicating that women and scientists of color were inferior to white and male scientists.[23][24]

Service

Pioneer Building, San Francisco, headquarters of OpenAI
ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, by San Francisco–based OpenAI, the creator of DALL·E 2 and Whisper AI. The service was launched as initially free to the public, with plans to monetize the service later.[25] By December 4, OpenAI estimated ChatGPT already had over one million users.[10] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest growing consumer application in that time frame.[26] CNBC wrote on December 15, 2022, that the service "still goes down from time to time".[27] The service works best in English, but is also able to function in some other languages, to varying degrees of success.[14] Unlike some other recent high-profile advances in AI, as of December 2022, there is no sign of an official peer-reviewed technical paper about ChatGPT.[28]

According to OpenAI guest researcher Scott Aaronson, OpenAI is working on a tool to attempt to digital watermark its text generation systems to combat bad actors using their services for academic plagiarism or spam.[29][30] The company says that this tool, called "AI classifier for indicating AI-written text"[31], will "likely yield a lot of false positives and negatives, sometimes with great confidence." An example cited in The Atlantic magazine showed that "when given the first lines of the Book of Genesis, the software concluded that it was likely to be AI-generated."[32]

The New York Times reported in December 2022 that it has been "rumored" that the next version of the AI, GPT-4, will be launched sometime in 2023.[1] In February 2023, OpenAI began accepting registrations from United States customers for a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, to cost $20 a month.[33] OpenAI is planning to release a ChatGPT Professional Plan that costs $42 per month, and the free plan is available when demand is low.

Reception
Positive

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman
ChatGPT was met in December 2022 with some positive reviews; Kevin Roose of The New York Times labeled it "the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public".[1] Samantha Lock of The Guardian newspaper noted that it was able to generate "impressively detailed" and "human-like" text.[34] Technology writer Dan Gillmor used ChatGPT on a student assignment, and found its generated text was on par with what a good student would deliver and opined that "academia has some very serious issues to confront".[35] Alex Kantrowitz of Slate magazine lauded ChatGPT's pushback to questions related to Nazi Germany, including the statement that Adolf Hitler built highways in Germany, which was met with information regarding Nazi Germany's use of forced labor.[36]

In The Atlantic magazine's "Breakthroughs of the Year" for 2022, Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of "the generative-AI eruption" that "may change our mind about how we work, how we think, and what human creativity really is".[37]

Kelsey Piper of the Vox website wrote that "ChatGPT is the general public's first hands-on introduction to how powerful modern AI has gotten, and as a result, many of us are [stunned]" and that ChatGPT is "smart enough to be useful despite its flaws".[38] Paul Graham of Y Combinator tweeted that "The striking thing about the reaction to ChatGPT is not just the number of people who are blown away by it, but who they are. These are not people who get excited by every shiny new thing. Clearly, something big is happening."[39] Elon Musk wrote that "ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI".[38] Musk paused OpenAI's access to a Twitter database pending a better understanding of OpenAI's plans, stating that "OpenAI was started as open-source and non-profit. Neither is still true."[40][41] Musk had co-founded OpenAI in 2015, in part to address existential risk from artificial intelligence, but had resigned in 2018.[41]


Google CEO Sundar Pichai upended the work of numerous internal groups in response to the threat of disruption by ChatGPT[42]
In December 2022, Google internally expressed alarm at the unexpected strength of ChatGPT and the newly discovered potential of large language models to disrupt the search engine business, and CEO Sundar Pichai "upended" and reassigned teams within multiple departments to aid in its artificial intelligence products, according to a report in The New York Times.[42] The Information website reported on January 3, 2023, that Microsoft Bing was planning to add optional ChatGPT functionality into its public search engine, possibly around March 2023.[43][44] According to CNBC reports, Google employees are intensively testing a chatbot called "Apprentice Bard", and Google is preparing to use this "apprentice" to compete with ChatGPT.[45]

Stuart Cobbe, a chartered accountant in England and Wales, decided to test the ChatGPT chatbot by entering questions from a sample exam paper on the ICAEW website and then entering its answers back into the online test. ChatGPT scored 42 percent, which, while below the 55 percent pass mark, was considered a reasonable attempt.[46]

Writing in Inside Higher Ed professor Steven Mintz states that he "consider[s] ChatGPT ... an ally, not an adversary." He went on to say that he felt the AI could assist educational goals by doing such things as making reference lists, generating "first drafts", solving equations, debugging, and tutoring. In the same piece, he also writes:[47]

I'm well aware of ChatGPT's limitations. That it's unhelpful on topics with fewer than 10,000 citations. That factual references are sometimes false. That its ability to cite sources accurately is very limited. That the strength of its responses diminishes rapidly after only a couple of paragraphs. That ChatGPT lacks ethics and can't currently rank sites for reliability, quality, or trustworthiness.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quoted in The New York Times as saying that AI's "benefits for humankind could be 'so unbelievably good that it's hard for me to even imagine.' (He has also said that in a worst-case scenario, A.I. could kill us all.)"[48]

Negative
In the months since its release, ChatGPT has been met with widespread and severe criticism from educators, journalists, artists, academics, and public advocates. James Vincent of The Verge website saw the viral success of ChatGPT as evidence that artificial intelligence had gone mainstream.[7] Journalists have commented on ChatGPT's tendency to "hallucinate."[49] Mike Pearl of the online technology blog Mashable tested ChatGPT with multiple questions. In one example, he asked ChatGPT for "the largest country in Central America that isn't Mexico." ChatGPT responded with Guatemala, when the answer is instead Nicaragua.[50] When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to "The Ballad of Dwight Fry," ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics.[27] Researchers cited by The Verge compared ChatGPT to a "stochastic parrot",[51] as did Professor Anton Van Den Hengel of the Australian Institute for Machine Learning.[52]

In December 2022, the question and answer website Stack Overflow banned the use of ChatGPT for generating answers to questions, citing the factually ambiguous nature of ChatGPT's responses.[3] In January 2023, the International Conference on Machine Learning banned any undocumented use of ChatGPT or other large language models to generate any text in submitted papers.[53]

Economist Tyler Cowen expressed concerns regarding its effects on democracy, citing its ability to produce automated comments, which could affect the decision process for new regulations.[54] An editor at The Guardian, a British newspaper, questioned whether any content found on the Internet after ChatGPT's release "can be truly trusted" and called for government regulation.[55]


Nick Cave mocked a song written by ChatGPT in his style
In January 2023, after being sent a song written by ChatGPT in the style of Nick Cave,[56] the songwriter himself responded on The Red Hand Files[57] (and was later quoted in The Guardian) saying the act of writing a song is "a blood and guts business ... that requires something of me to initiate the new and fresh idea. It requires my humanness." He went on to say "With all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit, a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human, and, well, I don’t much like it."[56][58]

In 2023, Australian MP Julian Hill advised the national parliament that the growth of AI could cause "mass destruction". During his speech, which was partly written by the program, that it could result in cheating, job losses, discrimination, disinformation, and uncontrollable military applications.[59]

Implications
In cybersecurity
Check Point Research and others noted that ChatGPT was capable of writing phishing emails and malware, especially when combined with OpenAI Codex.[60] OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, wrote that advancing software could pose "(for example) a huge cybersecurity risk" and also continued to predict "we could get to real AGI (artificial general intelligence) in the next decade, so we have to take the risk of that extremely seriously". Altman argued that, while ChatGPT is "obviously not close to AGI", one should "trust the exponential. Flat looking backwards, vertical looking forwards."[10]
